# MUSIC-GENRE-CLASSIFICATION
# Abstract
By creating a trustworthy and effective system for automatic classification utilizing machine learning algorithms and audio attributes taken from a dataset of 8,000 recordings, this project seeks to address the issue of manual classification of music genres. Moreover, clustering strategies will be used to find commonalities among overlapping genres. The outcomes of this project could be applied to music-related applications including playlist makers, recommendation systems, and music search engines.

# INTRODUCTION
It is a challenging task that might have a big impact on many music-related applications to automatically classify musical genres and identify similarities between them. The present manual classification techniques take a lot of time and are subjective, which causes genre classification to be inconsistent. In order to solve this issue, the projectâ€™s goal is to create an accurate and effective system for automatically classifying genres using machine learning algorithms and audio attributes taken from a data set of 8,000 tracks.

The aim of the project is to investigate how well different machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, and deep learning models, can categorize different musical genres using audio parameters including spectral properties, rhythmic patterns, and tone. In addition, clustering strategies like k-means and hierarchical clustering will be used to find connections between various genres, particularly those that overlap or have comparable traits.

The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a reliable and precise system for automatically classifying music genres that can be incorporated into music-related applications, such as playlist generators, recommendation systems, and music search engines, to enhance user experience and deliver more impartial genre classification results.
